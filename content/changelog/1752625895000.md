This pull request introduces an SSH auditing endpoint to track the start and end of SSH sessions initiated via the `p0` CLI. This is to meet Splunk's requirement for audit logs, enabling better tracking of CLI usage. The PR supports auditing `ssh`, `scp`, and `proxy` commands. It avoids other methods like using the `/command` endpoint, telemetry, or the `/integrations/ssh/public-key` endpoint due to limitations like covering more than just session access, potential unintended disabling of audit logs, or not always being called before session start. The changes are validated using sample commands and screenshots demonstrating the generated audit logs.  A related CLI PR is mentioned and a linear tracking issue is linked.
