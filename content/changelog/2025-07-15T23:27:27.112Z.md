This pull request fixes a bug where lateral movement wasn't displaying correctly in the graph due to outdated schema usage and missing permission data in the privileges data. The changes include updating the privileges data to include the permission used for lateral movement and modifying the lateral logic to group nodes according to the new permission schema. The changes were validated by inspecting the data structures to ensure they conform to the new schema.
