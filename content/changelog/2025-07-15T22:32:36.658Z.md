This pull request fixes an issue where lateral movement wasn't displaying correctly in the graph. The problem stemmed from two issues: missing permission data in the privileges and the lateral movement logic using an outdated schema. The solution involves updating the privileges data to include the used permission and modifying the `toLateral` logic to group lateral nodes based on the new schema. Validation was performed by inspecting the data structures to ensure they conform to the new schema. The included image provides visual confirmation of this.
