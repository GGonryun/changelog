This pull request introduces an SSH auditing endpoint to log the start and end of SSH sessions initiated via the p0 CLI. This change addresses a requirement from Splunk to track CLI usage for auditing purposes. The PR supports auditing for `ssh`, `scp`, and `ssh-proxy` commands. The implementation creates a dedicated proxy for audit logs from the CLI, which was chosen over alternative approaches like using the existing `/command` endpoint, telemetry, or the `/integrations/ssh/public-key` endpoint, due to their limitations and potential for unintended side effects. Validation involves using the specified commands with the corresponding CLI PR and verifying the correctness of the generated audit logs.
