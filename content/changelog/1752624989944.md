This pull request addresses the need for audit logs for SSH session starts from the p0 CLI, primarily for Splunk integration.  The change introduces a new `/integrations/ssh/` endpoint that acts as a proxy for audit logs when using `ssh`, `scp`, and `ssh-proxy` commands. It avoids relying on existing endpoints or telemetry due to limitations like covering broader use cases, potential coupling, or timing issues.  The PR is validated by ensuring correct audit log generation alongside the CLI PR #214, with sample commands provided.  The associated Linear issue is ENG-3248.  Screenshots of the audit logs are attached as evidence of functionality.
