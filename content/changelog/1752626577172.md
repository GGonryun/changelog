This pull request addresses the need to audit SSH session starts within the p0 CLI, primarily for Splunk integration. The change introduces a new `/integrations/ssh` endpoint acting as a proxy for SSH audit logs from the CLI, specifically tracking `ssh`, `scp`, and `proxy` commands. The PR avoids using existing endpoints like `/command`, telemetry, or `/integrations/ssh/public-key` due to their broader scope, opt-out possibilities, or timing inconsistencies.  The provided validation section describes how to test the changes using sample CLI commands and screenshots of the expected audit log output are included.  The work is tracked by Linear issue ENG-3248. A related CLI PR (https://github.com/p0-security/p0cli/pull/214) is also mentioned.
