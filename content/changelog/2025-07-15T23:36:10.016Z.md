This pull request fixes a bug where lateral movement was not being displayed in the graph due to outdated privilege data and an old schema used for parsing lateral nodes. The changes include updating the privilege data to include the permission used for lateral movement and updating the `toLateral` logic to group lateral nodes using the new schema. Validation was performed by inspecting the data structures to ensure they align with the new schema.
