This pull request fixes an issue where lateral movement wasn't being displayed in the graph. The problem was twofold: the privilege data lacked the permission used by the lateral node, and the logic parsing lateral movement was using an outdated schema. The solution involves updating the privilege data to include the permission and revising the "toLateral" logic to group lateral nodes according to the new schema. Validation was performed by inspecting the data structures to ensure they conform to the updated schema. The included screenshot likely depicts the data structure changes being validated.
