This pull request renames the "tag" field associated with instance types to "groupTag". This change is being made to allow for the future addition of other optional tag fields that will be used for identifying instances. Essentially, it's a refactoring to clarify the purpose of the existing "tag" and prepare for a more robust tagging system.
