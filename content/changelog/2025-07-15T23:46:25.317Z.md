This pull request introduces an SSH auditing endpoint to the p0 CLI backend. The goal is to provide Splunk with audit logs for SSH, SCP, and SSH-PROXY session starts initiated through the p0 CLI, allowing for better tracking of user access.  The PR avoids alternative solutions that were deemed less suitable due to either being too broad, tightly coupled with telemetry, or not consistently called before session starts.  The solution is validated in conjunction with a corresponding CLI pull request, and screenshots demonstrating correct audit log generation are provided.
