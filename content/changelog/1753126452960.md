This update improves the Microsoft Entra assessment by adding a new monitor that checks for users with disabled multi-factor authentication. It also prepares additional monitors for stale credentials and privileged users. Additionally, this update speeds up the collection of role information during the Entra assessment and collects data about when Entra credentials were last used.
