This pull request adds an SSH auditing endpoint to the backend service to log the start and end of SSH sessions initiated via the `p0 CLI`. This addresses a requirement from Splunk to track p0 CLI usage.  The solution introduces a dedicated `/integrations/ssh` endpoint acting as a proxy for audit logs. It supports `ssh`, `scp`, and `proxy` commands. The PR includes validation instructions using example CLI commands with various cloud providers and sudo usage, and provides screenshots of expected audit log output.  Alternative approaches like using the `/command` endpoint, telemetry, or the `/integrations/ssh/public-key` endpoint were considered and rejected due to limitations such as over-reporting, potential for opt-out, unnecessary coupling, and inaccurate timing. The PR is tracked by issue ENG-3248.
