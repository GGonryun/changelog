This pull request fixes a bug where lateral movement wasn't displaying correctly in the graph due to outdated data and parsing logic. Specifically, the privilege data lacked information about the permission used by the lateral node, and the parsing logic was based on an older schema. The PR updates the privilege data to include the necessary permission information and modifies the parsing logic to align with the new schema. The changes were validated by inspecting the data structures to ensure they match the new schema.
