This pull request introduces a new `/integrations/ssh` auditing endpoint to track the start and end of SSH sessions initiated via the p0 CLI (specifically, `ssh`, `scp`, and `ssh-proxy` commands). This addresses a requirement from Splunk to monitor CLI usage. The PR avoids alternative solutions like using the existing `/command` endpoint, telemetry, or the `/integrations/ssh/public-key` endpoint due to their limitations in accurately tracking session starts and avoiding unintended side effects. The change is validated using example commands and corresponding audit log outputs, shown in the included screenshots.  It is coupled with a corresponding change in the `p0cli` project. The Linear issue `ENG-3248` tracks this work.
