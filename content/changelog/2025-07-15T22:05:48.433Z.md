This pull request fixes a bug where lateral movement wasn't displaying correctly in the graph visualization. The issue stemmed from two problems: the privileges data was missing the permission used by the lateral node, and the lateral movement logic was using an outdated schema. The changes update the privileges data to include the necessary permission information and modifies the lateral movement logic to align with the new data schema. The fix was validated by inspecting the data structures to confirm they match the updated schema.
