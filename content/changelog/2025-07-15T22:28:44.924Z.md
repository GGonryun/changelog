This pull request fixes an issue where lateral movement was not displaying correctly in the graph due to outdated data and schema usage. The changes include:

*   Updating the privileges data to include the permission used by lateral movement nodes.
*   Updating the `toLateral` logic to correctly parse and group lateral nodes according to the new permission schema.

The changes were validated by verifying the data structures matched the new schema, as illustrated in the attached screenshot.
