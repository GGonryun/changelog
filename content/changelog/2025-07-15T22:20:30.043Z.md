This pull request fixes a bug where lateral movement wasn't showing up in the network graph due to outdated data and schema usage. The changes include updating the privileges data to include the specific permission used for lateral movement and updating the `toLateral` logic to correctly parse and group lateral nodes according to the new permission schema. The fix was validated by inspecting the data structures to ensure they conform to the new schema.
