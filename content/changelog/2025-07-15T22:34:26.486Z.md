This pull request fixes a bug where lateral movement wasn't being displayed correctly in the application's graph. The problem was caused by two issues: the privileges data lacked the permission used by lateral nodes, and the parsing logic was using an outdated schema. This PR addresses these issues by updating the privileges data to include the permission and updating the lateral parsing logic (`toLateral`) to align with the new schema. The changes were validated by inspecting the data structures to confirm they adhere to the new schema.
