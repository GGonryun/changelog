This update fixes an issue where routing rules based on group tags weren't applied to nodes without any group tags. Now, nodes without group tags are automatically assigned to an empty group, ensuring the rules are applied correctly. This allows users to restrict access to specific nodes based on group membership, even if some nodes don't have explicit group tags.
