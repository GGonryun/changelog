This pull request addresses the need for audit logs for SSH session starts in the p0 CLI, specifically for Splunk integration. The PR introduces a new `/integrations/ssh` endpoint to serve as a proxy for audit logs from the CLI for `ssh`, `scp`, and `proxy` commands. This approach was chosen over alternative methods like leveraging the `/command` endpoint, telemetry, or the `/integrations/ssh/public-key` endpoint due to accuracy, coupling concerns, and timing issues, respectively. The changes are validated with CLI changes in a separate PR and example commands are provided.
