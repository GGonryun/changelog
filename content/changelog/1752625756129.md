This pull request introduces an SSH auditing endpoint to track the start and end of SSH sessions initiated through the p0 CLI, fulfilling a requirement from Splunk. The solution creates a dedicated `/integrations/ssh` endpoint to proxy audit logs for `ssh`, `scp`, and `ssh-proxy` commands. The PR includes validation steps to ensure the audit logs generate correct information using sample commands with different providers (Azure, GCP, AWS).  The alternatives considered and discarded were using the existing `/command` endpoint (too broad), telemetry (undesirable coupling and opt-out issues), and the `/integrations/ssh/public-key` endpoint (incorrect timing and frequency). The pull request is linked to a linear.app tracking issue (ENG-3248) and includes screenshots demonstrating the generated audit logs.
